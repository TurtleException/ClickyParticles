# ClickyParticles
This is a simple spigot plugin that allows you to summon customizable particles when right-clicking other players.

Configure with `/clicky` or `/particles`.

This is a fairly straightforward plugin. However, if you have any suggestions or encounter any bugs, feel free to open
an issue or [contact me](https://github.com/TurtleException/) personally.
